  title: "Understanding Python Decorators"
  description: "A deep dive into Python decorators and their practical applications"
  language: "python"
  introduction: "Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to modify the behavior of functions and classes."
  code_example: |
    @timer
    def expensive_operation():
        # Simulating a time-consuming operation
        time.sleep(2)
        return "Operation completed"
  explanation: "When you use a decorator, you're essentially wrapping one function with another. This allows you to add functionality before, after, or around the original function."
  conclusion: "Decorators provide a clean and reusable way to modify or enhance functions and classes in Python."
