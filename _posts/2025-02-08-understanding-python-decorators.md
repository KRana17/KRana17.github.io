# Understanding Python Decorators

A deep dive into Python decorators

## Introduction
Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to modify function behavior.

## Code Example
```python
@timer
def expensive_operation():
    # Example operation
    time.sleep(2)
    return \"Operation completed\"
```

## Explanation
When you use a decorator, you are essentially wrapping one function with another.


## Conclusion
Decorators provide a clean and reusable way to modify function behavior.
